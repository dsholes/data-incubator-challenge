# Data Incubator Technical Challenge
## by Darren Sholes

Download this repo as a ZIP folder or `git clone` this repo into an appropriate folder on your machine.

To run the tool (`challenge_solution_dsholes.py`), you must have Python 3 and Numpy installed. 

Once all dependencies are installed, open the command line on your platform and change directory into `data-incubator-challenge` folder.

Run:
```
python challenge_solution_dsholes.py input.txt
```
Where `input.txt` is an input file to process line by line, similar to the input described in the Technical Challenge Description email:
```
1
2
3
137.036
```

The tool will print the results to the command line standard out.

I've included a test input file (`test_input.txt`).
